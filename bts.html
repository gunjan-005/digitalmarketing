   Build to Solve is an experiential learning workshop that emphasizes understanding real problems before creating solutions. Organized by the Department of Management Informatics and Communication at KU SOM, it trains students in structured, user-centered problem-solving approaches used in innovation and information systems, helping them move beyond assumptions to design practical, meaningful outcomes.

    <h2>What “Build to Solve” Really Means</h2>
    <p>
      At its core, Build to Solve is about shifting mindset. Instead of jumping straight to ideas or features, students are guided to begin with the problem itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by approaches such as Design Thinking, the workshop trains participants to empathize with users, clearly define problems, generate ideas, test solutions, and refine them through feedback. Complex challenges are broken into manageable parts, making them easier to understand and address.
    </p>
    <p>
      This philosophy prepares students to design products, systems, or services that deliver real value rather than purely theoretical answers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Principles Behind the Workshop</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem First:</strong> Every activity begins with a clearly defined problem statement, helping students identify root causes instead of relying on assumptions or trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Empathize and Define:</strong> Through interviews, observations, and field visits, participants understand challenges from the user’s perspective and define them more accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Iterative and Structured Thinking:</strong> Students follow a step-by-step process of ideation, testing, feedback, and improvement rather than searching for a single perfect solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Breaking Down Complexity:</strong> Large problems are divided into smaller, solvable parts to encourage logical and approachable problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Generate, Test, and Refine:</strong> Multiple ideas are explored, evaluated for feasibility, and tested with users to ensure relevance and impact.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Workshop Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The Build to Solve program follows a three-phase structure that emphasizes learning by doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Identification:</strong> Students investigate real-world challenges through research, interviews, and field engagement, strengthening their ability to recognize and clearly articulate genuine problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Solution Development:</strong> Teams brainstorm and prototype solutions with faculty mentorship, focusing on collaboration, creativity, and practicality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Application:</strong> Solutions are tested in real or simulated environments, with students reflecting on outcomes and refining ideas based on feedback.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Learning Through Practice</h2>
    <p>
      Students learn that effective solutions focus on outcomes rather than features. Instead of building generic tools, they address specific problems such as reducing confusion, improving access to information, or simplifying complex processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collaboration is central to the workshop. Diverse perspectives within teams lead to richer discussions and more thoughtful solutions, closely mirroring real-world innovation environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Recent Editions and Program Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The Build to Solve workshop has been conducted at Kathmandu University during April 2023, November 2024, and April 2025, primarily engaging second-semester BBIS students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier editions were also organized in collaboration with Siddhartha Vanasthali Institute (Panauti), Vijaya Samudayik Shiksha Sadan (Nawalpur), and Sajeelal Secondary School (Dullari–Morang).
    </p>
    <p>
      Across all editions, participants reported improved confidence in problem-solving, stronger teamwork skills, and a deeper sense of empathy toward users and communities.
