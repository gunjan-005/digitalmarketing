    Innovation at BBIS is driven by the belief that students learn best by doing. KU Merch is one of the most successful examples of this hands-on approach, created and led entirely by students under the Department of Management Informatics and Communication (DoMIC) at KU School of Management. What began as a small idea to address a campus need quickly grew into a structured project that brought together students from multiple schools across Kathmandu University.

    <h2>How Students Started KU Merch</h2>
    <p>
      The initiative began when BBIS students identified a growing need for reliable, comfortable, and accessible protective masks on campus during the pandemic. Rather than waiting for an external solution, the students took ownership of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      They designed, produced, and distributed fabric, non-medical masks to students and faculty across KUSOM, KUSOS, and KUSOE. A key focus was supporting freshers joining the university by encouraging safe practices through well-designed and durable masks.
    </p>

    <h2>Working Across Disciplines</h2>
    <p>
      KU Merch stands out as a multidisciplinary initiative where students collaborated with various departments to ensure the quality, safety, and effectiveness of their products.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaboration with Medical Science</h3>
    <p>
      The team consulted Dhulikhel Hospital to ensure their production process met health and safety standards. By aligning with WHO guidelines for protective masks, students ensured that each product was credible, safe, and professionally validated.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaboration with Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      To improve usability and comfort, students sought guidance from Architecture faculty and students. Their input helped refine the structure and fit of the masks, balancing practicality with comfort and durability.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaboration with Management</h3>
    <p>
      BBIS students led promotional strategies, marketing efforts, and outreach activities. The first major promotion occurred during the BBIS and BBA orientation on December 10, 2021, where the initial batch of masks was distributed, significantly increasing visibility across KU.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Student Engagement and Outreach</h2>
    <p>
      The KU Merch team actively participated in the KUSOM Carnival on December 24, 2021, setting up a stall to showcase and sell their products. Alongside masks, students offered tote bags and other merchandise, gaining hands-on experience in branding, sales, communication, and customer interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      To maintain engagement, the team launched an Instagram page for KU Merch. The platform was used to announce product updates, share behind-the-scenes work, and organize interactive giveaways, helping build a strong connection with the campus community.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Broader Impact</h2>
    <p>
      KU Merch later expanded its reach by sponsoring customized, limited-edition masks for TEDxKathmanduUniversity. Students handled both design and production, while also creating additional units for sale. This demonstrated their ability to manage specialized production and event-based merchandising.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Future Vision Led by Students</h2>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, the KU Merch team aims to continue identifying problems within and beyond the university environment. Their vision is to develop meaningful products that solve real challenges while highlighting the creativity and capability of BBIS students.
    </p>
    <p>
      KU Merch represents student innovation at KU SOM—initiative-driven, collaborative, impactful, and rooted in real-world problem solving.
